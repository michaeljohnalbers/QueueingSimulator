  This is an example of a simulation definition file. It isn't necessarily
  absolutely correct. Instead it is to serve as a reference or guide of what
  simulation definition files should look like.

<!-- Defines a single simulation. It includes all plugins needed, excepting the
     Basic plugin, as well as all the Actors and their initial states. -->

  <!-- Random number engine seed. -->
  <seed>12345</seed>

  <!-- List of plugins used. Names match with the plugin name in each plugin
       definition file. As many as are neede can be specified. Each plugin that
       is required must be specified. -->
  <plugin>Football</plugin>

  <!-- Size of the world. Units are meters. Width is the x axis, length is the
       y axis. Origin is in the lower left corner. -->

  <!-- Each individual Actor in the simulation is listed here. -->
  <actors>
    <!-- Specific actor. This will cause this Actor to be added to the
	 simulation. The source must be from one of the listed plugins (if no
         source is specified the Basic plugin is assumed). The type must match
         one of the Actor types listed in the source plugin. -->
